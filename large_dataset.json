{"content": "Expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses. For example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a product line of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. Subtracting any paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this product line. Under the Bornhuetter Ferguson methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. For example, for a long- tail product line of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be used to represent the 90 percent of losses still unreported. The actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. Subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. In the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. The result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. Actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. If the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the Bornhuetter Ferguson method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. Thus, the Bornhuetter Ferguson method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the product line of business. Loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. In the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.","annotation":[{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":2109,"end":2123,"text":"ultimate losses"}]},{"label":["percent"],"points":[{"start":2090,"end":2100,"text":" 10 percent"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":2044,"end":2054,"text":" $1 million"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":2026,"end":2040,"text":"reported losses"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":2006,"end":2016,"text":"$10 million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":1627,"end":1646,"text":"expected loss ratio "}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":1598,"end":1608,"text":" $7 million"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":1575,"end":1586,"text":"$7.3 million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":1514,"end":1517,"text":"loss"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":1489,"end":1498,"text":"$1 million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":1477,"end":1482,"text":"losses"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":1369,"end":1380,"text":"$6.3 million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":1350,"end":1364,"text":"unreported loss"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":1312,"end":1322,"text":"$10 million"}]},{"label":["percent"],"points":[{"start":1259,"end":1268,"text":"63 percent"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":382,"end":391,"text":"$7 million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":365,"end":378,"text":"loss estimate "}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":295,"end":305,"text":"$10 million"}]},{"label":["percent"],"points":[{"start":247,"end":256,"text":"70 percent"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":233,"end":242,"text":"loss ratio"}]}],"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1551842549000,"last_updated_at":1551842549000,"sec_taken":1090,"last_updated_by":"Bme67ziMyNaYaoTcsc8iazB4jKX2","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}

Our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at December 31, 2017, decreased by $3.3 billion compared to December 31, 2016.

This increase was largely driven by adverse emergence in both general liability and umbrella auto liability, reflecting worsening trends in the number and nature of high severity losses. Approximately $411 million of the unfavorable development is related to automobile liability. Based on the adverse emergence we updated our assumptions about loss severity, loss development patterns and expected loss ratios for the most recent accident years. We have seen an increasing trend in the frequency of high severity claims, especially in the umbrella automobile liability portfolio. We also observed deterioration in certain class action claims that have complex coverage uncertainties and high limits characterized by increases in new claims and/or demands reported in 2015 and progress towards potential settlements, which have further informed our actuarial projections of ultimate losses for these types of claims.  These types of claim classes have the longest emergence period within the excess casualty class and can impact multiple accident years, and are therefore inherently more volatile.

In addition, the stock market in general, which can be impacted by various factors, including overall economic and political conditions, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume  fluctuations  that  have  often  been  unrelated  or  disproportionate  to  the  operating  performance  of  those companies. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock regardless of our actual operating performance. We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that our share repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves. In October 2016, our board of directors authorized our company to repurchase up to $7,019,340,976.83 of our Class  C  capital  stock.

The share repurchase program, authorized by our board of directors, does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares.

{"content": "Cost of revenues increased $10,445 million from 2016 to 2017. The increase was due to an increase in TAC of $4,879 million. The increase in TAC to distribution partners was a result of an increase in Google properties revenues and the associated TAC rate. The increase in TAC to Google Network Members was a result of an increase in Google Network Members' properties revenues and the associated TAC rate.  The increase in the Google properties TAC rate was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The increase in the Network Members TAC rate was driven by the continued underlying shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying. The increase in the aggregate TAC rate was also partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Google Network Members' properties to Google properties. Other cost of revenues increased $5,566 million from 2016 to 2017. The increase was due to various factors, including an increase in data center and other operations costs, which include depreciation, compensation expenses (including  SBC),  energy,  bandwidth,  and  other  equipment  costs  as  a  result  of  business  growth;  hardware  costs associated with new hardware launches; and content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to YouTube. Cost of revenues increased $6,974 million from 2015 to 2016 due to various factors including traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, content acquisition costs, and hardware costs. The increase in traffic acquisition costs of $2,450  million  was  due  to  increases  in  advertising  revenues  primarily  from  the  growth  of  mobile  search  and programmatic ad buying which carry higher TAC. The increase in other cost of revenues of $4,524 million was primarily due to increases in (1) data center costs including depreciation, labor, energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs as a result of business growth, (2) content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to YouTube, (3) hardware costs associated with new hardware launches, and (4) stock-based compensation. The aggregate TAC rate remained relatively flat from 2015 to 2016 primarily as a result of a shift of mix from Google  Network  Members'  properties  revenue  to  Google  properties  revenue.  Our  aggregate TAC  rate  was  also impacted by the increase in mobile and programmatic advertising buying, which generally carry overall higher TAC. The increase in Google properties TAC rate was primarily driven by a shift to mobile and more mobile searches are subject to TAC. The increase in Network Members' TAC rate was primarily driven by the shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying.","annotation":[{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":1888,"end":1901,"text":"$4,524 million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":1868,"end":1883,"text":"cost of revenues"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":1722,"end":1743,"text":"advertising  revenues "}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":1675,"end":1690,"text":" $2,450  million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":1647,"end":1671,"text":"traffic acquisition costs"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":1500,"end":1503,"text":"2016"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":1492,"end":1496,"text":"2015 "}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":1472,"end":1486,"text":"$6,974 million "}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":1445,"end":1460,"text":"Cost of revenues"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":1034,"end":1037,"text":"2017"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":1026,"end":1029,"text":"2016"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":1006,"end":1019,"text":"$5,566 million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":973,"end":994,"text":"Other cost of revenues"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":108,"end":121,"text":"$4,879 million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":101,"end":103,"text":"TAC"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":56,"end":59,"text":"2017"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":48,"end":51,"text":"2016"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":27,"end":41,"text":"$10,445 million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":0,"end":15,"text":"Cost of revenues"}]}],"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1551760094000,"last_updated_at":1551760094000,"sec_taken":836,"last_updated_by":"Bme67ziMyNaYaoTcsc8iazB4jKX2","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}

Facility closures during the same period resulted in a charge of $1.6 million. In addition, certain austerity measures and efforts to streamline our overhead and support structure initiated in the previous year continued.  During the year ended  December 31, 2015, the global workforce was reduced by 30%, resulting in a related aggregate charge of $10.9 million. While North America rig count is expected to continue to increase during 2017, weakness in international and offshore markets is expected to continue. We see some opportunities to start to increase pricing in North America, however prevalent overcapacity will likely limit pricing power throughout 2017. We are also facing risks that cost inflation will exceed price increases in the short term.","annotation":[{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":829,"end":841,"text":"$10.9 million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":809,"end":824,"text":"aggregate charge"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":726,"end":742,"text":"December 31, 2015"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":545,"end":556,"text":"$1.6 million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":535,"end":540,"text":"charge"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":466,"end":477,"text":"$4.4 million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":456,"end":461,"text":"charge"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":333,"end":349,"text":"December 31, 2016"}]}],"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1551927410000,"last_updated_at":1551927410000,"sec_taken":194,"last_updated_by":"Bme67ziMyNaYaoTcsc8iazB4jKX2","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}

Return on average tangible segment capital, a non-GAAP measure, is computed in the same manner as return on average segment capital except the computation excludes from average segment capital average goodwill and other intangibles of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2015 and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013. We believe return on average tangible segment capital is a useful measure of the profitability of our business. (c) Historically, due to system constraints, net loss ratio as a % of charge volume and 90 days past billing as a % of receivables were presented. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, as a result of system enhancements, net write-off rate ï¿½ principal only, net write-off rate ï¿½ principal and fees and 30 days past due as a % of total are presented. (d) Refer to Table 7 footnote (f). (e) Adjusted net interest income, adjusted average loans and net interest yield on Card Member loans are non-GAAP measures. Refer to ï¿½Glossary of Selected Terminologyï¿½ for the definitions of these terms. We believe adjusted net interest income and adjusted average loans are useful to investors because they are components of net interest yield on Card Member loans, which provides a measure of profitability of our Card Member loan portfolio.","annotation":[{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":763,"end":766,"text":"2013"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":741,"end":757,"text":"December 31, 2014"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":725,"end":736,"text":"$1.4 billion"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":702,"end":719,"text":" December 31, 2015"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":687,"end":698,"text":"$1.2 billion"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":645,"end":683,"text":"average goodwill and other intangibles "}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":445,"end":448,"text":"2013"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":436,"end":439,"text":"2014"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":414,"end":425,"text":"$3.0 billion"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":405,"end":408,"text":"2015"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":388,"end":399,"text":"$3.2 billion"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":354,"end":385,"text":"one-year average segment capital"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":326,"end":329,"text":"2013"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":317,"end":320,"text":"2014"}]},{"label":["date"],"points":[{"start":311,"end":314,"text":"2015"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":294,"end":305,"text":"$631 million"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":277,"end":288,"text":"$411 million"}]},{"label":["money"],"points":[{"start":263,"end":274,"text":"$421 million"}]},{"label":["financial"],"points":[{"start":231,"end":260,"text":"one-year period segment income"}]}],"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1551888106000,"last_updated_at":1551888106000,"sec_taken":1560,"last_updated_by":"Bme67ziMyNaYaoTcsc8iazB4jKX2","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}
